# RSI Research Surface Expansion

## Overview
This repository contains a proof‑of‑concept to broaden the RSI research surface beyond arXiv and GitHub. The goal is to gather metadata from a variety of public sources (search engines, preprint servers, patents, blogs, code hosting platforms) while keeping the stack free and account‑free.

## Implementation Plan
Each task is marked with a status:
- `❌ Pending`
- `✅ Completed`
- `🚧 Blocked`

 | 4.2 | Write `store_results.py` to persist query, raw search, and harvested data | ✅ Completed |
 | 4.3 | Implement simple duplicate detection (URL hash) | ✅ Completed |

### Phase 5 – Packaging & Demo
| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
 | 5.1 | Create a command‑line interface (`rsi_search.py`) that orchestrates all modules | ✅ Completed |
| 5.2 | Generate a Markdown summary (`summary.md`) per query | ❌ Pending |
| 5.3 | Write a README with usage instructions | ❌ Pending |
| 5.4 | Add a sample run output in the repository | ❌ Pending |

### Phase 6 – Validation & Testing
| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.1 | Run a full pipeline on the test keyword `"recursive self‑improvement"` | ❌ Pending |
| 6.2 | Verify that at least one result is harvested from each source type | ❌ Pending |
| 6.3 | Ensure no rate‑limit errors occur | ❌ Pending |

### Phase 7 – Finalisation
| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 7.1 | Mark all completed tasks and remove `TODO.md` or archive it | ❌ Pending |
| 7.2 | Notify via email that implementation is finished | ❌ Pending |

## Notes
- All external calls are rate‑limited; implement exponential back‑off where necessary.
- The project is intentionally minimalistic to keep dependencies light (requests, beautifulsoup4, pyyaml, tqdm).
- For privacy, the script will only scrape publicly accessible pages.
- Future enhancements (translation, PDF extraction) will be added in later phases.
